The Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competiton. With data being provided of varoius passengers traveling on the ship I have used libraries
like numpy,pandas to manipulate , explore and analyze the data and libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualise the data. Lastly I have used various machine learning 
models to make predictions on the formerly cleaned and preprocessed data. Then I used GridSearchCV to optimise the parameters of the various models

Finally I got an accuracy of 0.77511 on the kaggle test set .
